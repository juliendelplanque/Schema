# Schema
Library for validating data structure such as those obtained from config-files, forms, external services or command-line parsing, converted from JSON/YAML (or something else) to Pharo data-types.

This library is inspired from [Python's Schema library](https://pypi.org/project/schema/), thanks to the original developers for the inspiration.
